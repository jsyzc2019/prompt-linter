```

In total, there are 104,901 hrefs. However, we have only 93134 files downloaded. Possible causes:
-  Duplicate hrefs since some files import more than one library
- 404 error, some files removed from github soon after it was detected by our script

There are 157k results on github with the following search query: 
```
"import guidance" OR "from guidance" OR "import openai" OR "from openai" OR "import langchain" OR "from langchain" OR  "import anthropic" OR "from anthropic" OR "import llamaindex" OR "from llamaindex" OR "import cohere" OR "from cohere" language:Python -repo:pisterlabs/prompt-linter
```
Since we now have 93k files, the dataset contains ~59% of open source file count.
